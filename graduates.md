	<h4>About Sankoré</h4>
	<p>We have created Sankoré to be an indelible experience for nurturing learners. All aspects of our institution have been designed with interconnectedness in mind - the relationship between what we're learning, how we're learning, where we're learning, and with whom we're learning have all been meticulously considered and built with relentless precision. Our partnerships with leading global institutions and progressive designers at Education Design International, PlussEd+, The Chapin School, The Riverdale School, Delta Global and countless others have produced an institution for leading and innovation like nowhere else in the world.</p>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/outdoor-walkway-small.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our approach to learning is drawn from leading research and practices around the globe and designed with the 21 Century Learner at the center of facilitation. When we consider the whole child, we are mindful of their growth not only in traditional academic areas, but their co-curicular life as well. We provide state of the art facilities and instruction in the arts, technology and innovation, environmental stewardship, sporting and competition, and mindfulness.</p>

What if that decision meant the difference between whether or not you could go to class. In Kibera, where I’m from, students need to wear uniforms to go to school and many students can’t access an education because they can’t afford uniforms. So, what if we at Taft made a connection to the people from my community by donating necessary funds so that students in Kibera can go to school. The Taft Shirt Off Your Back Project is simple, look down at what you’re wearing right now, choose one item, and donate the value of that item to help educate students in Kibera.” She bravely shared the video at school assembly, parents’ weekend, and during the YYGS session she attended. In the end, she raised $2,500.</p>

In July, Hereniah joined KenSAP as a SHOFCO Scholar. Although her national exam resulst were impressive, she was surrounded by 18 other scholars all who scored in the top .5% of the nation. Once again, this just further fueled Hereniahs fire. I have received candid feedback from the KenSAP Excutive Director that Hereniah was 1 of 2 of the most helpful and valued members of the KenSAP Scholars Program this cycle. Although she joined as a SHOFCO scholar, KenSAP is committeed to continuing to support her through her university journey in the US. While at a KenSAP fundraiser, she wowed those sitting at her table and left with an internship at one of the best law firms in Kenya.</p>
