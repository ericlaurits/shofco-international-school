SHOFCO has emerged as a global leader in community-based grassroots organization building promise from poverty. When we envisioned the evolution of our education institutions, we began explore how to begin to build networks of learners from all walks of life and connect Kenya's mission-driven families across socioeconomic divides. Our mixed-income school, Sankoré, was born. 

At SHOFCO, Our mission is to unleash the inherent power, dignity, and hope of communities in informal settlements -- creating opportunities for them to thrive. We envision a world where empowered local communities hold the voice, access, and knowledge to shape a future defined by resilience, equality, and boundless opportunity.

At SHOFCO we value connection, innovation, transparency, empathy, and accountability. Those ideals are woven throughout Sankoré and serve as guiding principles for how we think about all children and communities when building our mixed-income school. 

SHOFCO's founding story:
Kennedy Odede became a street child at the age of 10 and lived in the Kibera Slum for 23 years. During this time, he experienced extreme poverty, violence, a lack of opportunity and deep gender inequality. 

However, Kennedy also witnessed the palpable hope that persists in slums and recognized that people sought something different for themselves, their families and their communities. Visionaries like Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela showed him that great systemic change can come from within. Women like Kennedy's mother inspired him to build the solutions to urban poverty through addressing one of its core obstacles--the prohibitive level of gender inequality. 

Through earning $1 for 10 hours of work at a factory, he managed to save 20 cents to buy a soccer ball, which he used to bring community members together. After playing soccer, he would sit down with his friends to speak about the challenges in the community and devise solutions, together, in a safe and enjoyable environment. In 2004, SHOFCO was born as a result.

In 2007, Kennedy met Jessica Posner, a bright and driven American student studying abroad, who today is his wife. Together they devised SHOFCO's holistic model and grew the organization from a school for girls to one that serves over 2.4 million people. 

Bolstered by grassroots knowledge, they have dedicated their lives to bringing hope to communities in Kenya.
