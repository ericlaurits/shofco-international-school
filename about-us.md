	<h4>About Sankoré</h4>
	<p>We have created Sankoré to be an indelible experience for nurturing learners. All aspects of our institution have been designed with interconnectedness in mind - the relationship between what we're learning, how we're learning, where we're learning, and with whom we're learning have all been meticulously considered and built with relentless precision. Our partnerships with leading global institutions and progressive designers at Education Design International, PlussEd+, The Chapin School, The Riverdale School, Delta Global and countless others have produced an institution for leading and innovation like nowhere else in the world.</p>
	<p><span class="image right"><img src="assets/images/outdoor-walkway-small.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our approach to learning is drawn from leading research and practices around the globe and designed with the 21 Century Learner at the center of facilitation. When we consider the whole child, we are mindful of their growth not only in traditional academic areas, but their co-curicular life as well. We provide state of the art facilities and instruction in the arts, technology and innovation, environmental stewardship, sporting and competition, and mindfulness.</p>

		<h5>Our Learning Campus</h5>
		<p>Where will our children be learning?</p>
	</header>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/images/biophilic1-small.jpg" alt="" /></span>Our learners are the next generation of leaders, change-makers, activists, and innovators. They are the individuals creating the job opportunities for others. What is most important to us? The same thing that is most important to you - who your child is now and who your child will become. What supports can we, as a comminity, provide for that child to grow beyond their greatest potential? With that in mind, our admissions process is not assessment based. Your child will not have to sit for academic and behavorial assessments and surveys, nor will you as their family. Instead, we invite learners to share with us who they are, their current wishes and dreams, through whatever means they choose. We have recieved "day in the life" video submissions, poster presentations, artwork, and even mock presidential campain posters and speeches. Our requirement is to answer the decptively simple question: <i>Who are you, truly?</i> Who are you as an individual and who are you as a family?. Further details regarding our admissions process are provided when invitations for our next round of learners are sent out each year.</p>

		<h5>School Calendar</h5>
	</header>
	<p>Our school schedule follows an American aligned schedule, as many of our graduates explore university experiences in the United States. This is a September - June calendar with extended breaks in December and April and Kenyan Holidays observed. Our year is broken into 2 Semesters/4 terms in alignment with American schooling structures. </p>
